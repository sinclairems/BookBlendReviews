# Book Blend Reviews
We saw a need for an application that assists in selecting your next book while also providing access to reviews from fellow book enthusiasts, allowing users to both view and contribute reviews. Enjoy our site!

Here's what you'll see when you visit [Book Blend Reviews](https://book-blend-reviews-e430070779d0.herokuapp.com/)
